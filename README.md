# Homework-9

Homework 9s goal was to create a Readme generator using the processes of Node.js and other technologies including NPM and the integrated terminal in Visual studio code. This project was designed to use a set of "rules/ Questions" to fill out a promp and save those answers to a readme file therfore generating the new readme. This worked pretty well as when you input the answers to all of the questions the readme file is generated. This could be usefull in many ways including if you have a lot of projects you need to work on and dont have time to sit down and think out every single readme or if you want the structure of your readmes to be the same every time as to stay organized, then using a readme generator is for you.
